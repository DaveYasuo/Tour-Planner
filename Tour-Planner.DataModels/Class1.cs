         * This DataModels project contains a number of sub-folders, grouping similar types of classes together.
         * The Collections folder typically contains an extension of the ObservableCollection<T> class for each data model class in the application.
         * The Enums folder is also often well used in most WPF applications, as enumerations are great to use when data bound to either radio buttons or checkboxes.
         *
         * The interfaces found in the Interfaces folder are essential to enable the functionality of the base classes, as we'll see in Chapter 3, Writing Custom Application Frameworks.
         * If we're likely to use a large number of delegates in our application, then it also makes sense to organize them into a separate Delegates folder as well.
         * Otherwise, if a delegate is strongly tied to a particular class, they can just be declared locally in the classes that will be raising them.
