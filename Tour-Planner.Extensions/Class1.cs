         * Both examples show an Extensions project, but this is entirely optional and not a requirement of the MVVM pattern.
         * I just happen to find Extension methods to be an essential part of .NET development, having built up a large collection of invaluable helper methods.
         * After getting used to being able to call Add on an IEnumerable instance or ToObservableCollection on a query result for example, I now reuse them in every application.
         * We'll see some examples of these in Chapter 3 , Writing Custom Application Frameworks, Chapter 8, Implementing Responsive Data Validation, and Chapter 9, Completing That Great User Experience.
